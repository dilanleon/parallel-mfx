Parallel Bandpass Drum Dynamics and Harmonics Processor

Inspired by this video: https://youtu.be/4hGBYs10ZAU?si=jQk2Dl15u7sJtUK1

TL:DW is that this is a technique to make drums sound awesome through dynamics and harmonics processing on a parallel bandpass filter applied to the fundemental frequency.

Uses Spotify's Pedalboard API: https://spotify.github.io/pedalboard/index.html

Currently, main.py simply opens an audio stream after asking the user for input and output devices.
