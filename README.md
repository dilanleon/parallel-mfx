Parallel Bandpass Drum Dynamics Processor

Inspired by this video: https://youtu.be/4hGBYs10ZAU?si=jQk2Dl15u7sJtUK1

TL:DW is that this is a technique to make drums sound awesome through dynamics and harmonics processing on a parallel bandpass filter applied to the fundemental frequency.

Uses Spotify's Pedalboard API: https://spotify.github.io/pedalboard/index.html

Currently just a demo that tests for null (and succeeds!)
