<b>MultiFX Processor</b>

Originally inspired by this video: https://youtu.be/4hGBYs10ZAU?si=jQk2Dl15u7sJtUK1, but is now just general multiFX with a dry passthrough

run 'pip install pedalboard' in your terminal first!

Uses Spotify's Pedalboard API: https://spotify.github.io/pedalboard/index.html

Ambiances by EchoThief: http://www.echothief.com/

Displays a toggleable list of effects, dry/wet mutes, and effect parameters that update in realtime

TO DO in (more or less) order:
- Convolution select
- Finish adding other filter modes
- Compressor Makeup Gain
- LFOs capable of targeting any knob
- Figure out how to access the data within the AudioStream
- VU meters?? Maybe impossible maybe very easy?? Haven't experimented
- Verify functionality on Windows/Linux
