<b>Parallel Bandpass Drum Dynamics, Harmonics, and Reverb Processor</b>

Inspired by this video: https://youtu.be/4hGBYs10ZAU?si=jQk2Dl15u7sJtUK1

TL:DW is that this is a technique to make drums sound awesome through dynamics and harmonics processing on a parallel bandpass filter applied to the fundemental frequency.
Equivalent signal chain in Pro Tools:

Displays a toggleable list of effects, dry/wet mutes, and effect parameters that update in realtime

TO DO in (more or less) order:
- Add bitcrush, delay, chorus (should be EZPZ)
- Convolution select
- Finish adding other filter modes
- Compressor Makeup Gain
- LFOs capable of targeting any knob
- Figure out how to access the data within the AudioStream
- VU meters?? Maybe impossible maybe very easy?? Haven't experimented
- Verify functionality on Windows/Linux
