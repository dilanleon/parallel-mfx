<b>Parallel Bandpass Drum Dynamics, Harmonics, and Reverb Processor</b>

Inspired by this video: https://youtu.be/4hGBYs10ZAU?si=jQk2Dl15u7sJtUK1

TL:DW is that this is a technique to make drums sound awesome through dynamics and harmonics processing on a parallel bandpass filter applied to the fundemental frequency.
Equivalent signal chain in Pro Tools:

In its current state, only asks the user to select I/O drivers and then begins to play audio. 

TO DO in (more or less) order:
- Implementation of 'Fader' class
- UI layout
- User interactible enabling/disabling of plugins
- Tying a bunch of knobs to AudioHandler class parameters/functions
- Figure out how to access the data within the AudioStream
- 'Switch' class capable of toggling between two plugins for a given spot in the signal chain
- VU meters?? Maybe impossible maybe very easy?? Haven't experimented
- Drop down menus (i.e. for IR select, filter select)
- Verify functionality on Windows/Linux
- Verify functionality through Pro Tools Audio Bridge/other virtual sound drivers
- Figure out VST/AAX support? might be a pipe dream (probably)
- Super duper pretty-fication (like a Universal Audio plugin)
